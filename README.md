# Data-Science-Cookbook
A reflection from my intro to data science class in a nutshell mainly focusing on using pandas dataframes and the inbuilt functions and tools that could be used to summarize datasets, data visualization, web scraping and workign with API's. I have imported data from Our World in Data to break it down into different forms and also perorm visualiaations on it using matplotlib and seaborn and many more. I have used my Project 6 API operations and functions for the cookbook as an example to show how to work around API's. It might not be the perfect cookbook you would want but its certainly the cookbook that every beginner data scientist would want to look and take reference from.  That being said have fun explorng through my work!
