# Data-Science-Cookbook
A reflection from my intro to data science class in a nutshell mainly focusing on using pandas dataframes and the inbuilt functions and tools that could be used to summarize datasets, data visualization, web scraping and working with API's. I have imported csv file on the change of Mortality Rate since the 1990's from around the world, from Our World in Data to break it down into different forms and also perform visualizations on it using matplotlib and seaborn and many more. I have used my Project 6 API operations and functions for the cookbook as an example to show how to work around API's. I have also used Beautiful Soup, requests and Json for web scraping.

It might not be the perfect cookbook you would want but its certainly the perfect cookbook that every beginner data scientist would want to look and take reference from. That being said have fun explorng through my work!
